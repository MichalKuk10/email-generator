Email Application project.

In reality, this is more advanced than the above project but still at the juniors's level.

The cool thing about this project is that it imitates specifications just like real-world projects.

It  bring the  concept learning about how to generate a random password using Math.random function, how to use OOPs concepts like encapsulation.

In this simple email application, I will code the simple email operations like set the mailbox capacity, set the alternate email, change the password, etc.
